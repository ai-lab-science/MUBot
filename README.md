# MUBot-Control-and-Monitoring-Using-ROS-Navigation-Stack-and-ROS-Mobile-App
This repository is about autonomous navigation and SLAM with MUBot in our laboratory virtual environment as well as its real-time control and monitoring from ROS-Mobile App leveraging on the framework developed by [Rottmann Nils et al](https://github.com/ROS-Mobile/ROS-Mobile-Android).  The robot runs on ROS Noetic  and ROS Melodic with laptop or Nvidia Jetson Nano used as the host computer. The hardware implementation and documentation has already been described in [this repository](https://github.com/ai-lab-science/MUBot-The-design-documentation-Remote-Control-and-ROS-Simulation). It is necessary to go through the repository to set up the environment and install other ROS packages not mentioned here.
